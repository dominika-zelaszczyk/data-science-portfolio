# Data Science Portfolio
Comprehensive data science portfolio showcasing projects in machine learning, data analysis, visualization, and deep learning. Includes Jupyter notebooks, datasets, and code samples.

*Note: Data used in the projects is for demonstration purposes only.*
## Contents

- ### Machine Learning

    - [Titanic Survival Prediction](https://github.com/dominika-zelaszczyk/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/Projects/Titanic%20Survival%20Prediction%20Using%20Machine%20Learning/Titanic%20Survivor%20Prediction.ipynb):
This project predicts Titanic passenger survival based on various features like passenger class, age, and fare. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and model building to analyze key factors influencing survival.

    - [Diabetes Disease Detection with XG-Boost and Neural Networks](https://github.com/dominika-zelaszczyk/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/Projects/Diabetes%20Disease%20Detection%20with%20XG-Boost%20and%20Neural%20Networks/Diabetes%20Detection%20Using%20XGBoost%20and%20ANNs.ipynb):
This project aims to predict diabetes in female patients using diagnostic measurements from the Pima Indian dataset. The dataset includes features such as pregnancies, glucose levels, BMI, and age. The project implements two machine learning models: XGBoost for its efficiency in handling tabular data and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for deep learning classification. Both models are evaluated for accuracy in detecting diabetes, with key steps in data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and performance analysis included.

    *Tools: scikit-learn, Keras, XGBoost, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn*

- ### Natural Language Processing

    - [Fake News Detection](https://github.com/dominika-zelaszczyk/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/Projects/Fake%20News%20Detection%20with%20Machine%20Learning/FakeNewsClassification.ipynb):
The project aims to detect fake news using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). It leverages a variety of tools to classify news as real or fake based on textual data.

    *Tools: Keras, NLTK, spaCy, Gensim, WordCloud, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib/Seaborn*

- ### Data Analysis

    - [Biodiversity in National Parks](https://github.com/dominika-zelaszczyk/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/Projects/Biodiversity%20in%20National%20Parks/biodiversity.ipynb): 
The project analyzes biodiversity data from the National Parks Service to explore species' conservation status and distribution across parks. It uses statistical analysis and visualization to answer questions about endangered species and their prevalence, using fictional data inspired by real-world scenarios.

    *Tools: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn, Statistical analysis*
